## 🔹 70. Multi-Account Strategies
---
### 📖 Description
- A best practice approach to structuring your AWS environment using multiple AWS accounts. This strategy is facilitated and managed using AWS Organizations.

### ⚙️ Key Features (of implementing the strategy)
- **Security Boundaries**: Limit the "blast radius" of security incidents. A compromise in one account is less likely to affect resources in other accounts.
- **Resource Isolation**: Separate environments like production, development, and testing into different accounts for better control and to prevent accidental impact.
- **Billing Granularity & Cost Allocation**: Track costs more easily by department, project, or environment by assigning them to separate accounts.
- **Simplified Governance & Compliance**: Apply different security and compliance policies (e.g., via SCPs) to different sets of accounts based on their purpose (e.g., stricter controls for production accounts).
- **Team Autonomy**: Allows different teams to manage their own AWS resources within the guardrails set by the organization.

### 📝 Core Idea
- Using multiple AWS accounts, managed by AWS Organizations, to improve security, operational agility, and cost management.

---

## 🔹 71. Service Control Policies (SCPs) - Feature of AWS Organizations
---
### 📖 Description
- Policies that you attach to elements in your AWS Organization (like the organization root, OUs, or individual accounts) to manage permissions. SCPs offer central control over the *maximum available permissions* for all IAM users and roles in an account.

### ⚙️ Key Features
- **Permission Guardrails**: Define what AWS services and actions are allowed or denied for accounts within an OU or the entire organization.
    - Example: Deny access to unused regions, or prevent member accounts from disabling essential security services like CloudTrail.
- **Do Not Grant Permissions**: SCPs themselves *do not grant* any permissions. They act as filters. IAM users and roles in an account still need to be granted permissions via identity-based or resource-based policies.
- **Effective Permissions**: The effective permissions for an IAM user/role are the intersection of what is allowed by the SCP and what is granted by IAM policies. An explicit deny in an SCP overrides any allow in an IAM policy.
- **Applied to OUs or individual accounts**: (Cannot be applied to the management account of the organization).
- **Inheritance**: SCPs attached to an OU are inherited by all accounts and OUs within that OU.

### 📝 Core Idea
- Centrally enforce permission boundaries (guardrails) across accounts in your AWS Organization, ensuring accounts operate within defined limits.

### 🔄 Differences
- **vs. IAM Policies**:
    - IAM Policies (Identity-based or Resource-based): Grant specific permissions to users, groups, or roles *within* an account.
    - SCPs: Define the *maximum permissible actions* for accounts within an organization. They act as a filter on top of IAM policies, restricting what IAM policies can effectively grant.

## 🔹 72. AWS Control Tower
---
### 📖 Description
- A service that provides the easiest way to set up and govern a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. It automates the creation of a "landing zone."

### ⚙️ Key Features
- **Automated Landing Zone Setup**: Orchestrates multiple AWS services (including AWS Organizations, IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO), Service Catalog, CloudTrail, Config) to build a well-architected multi-account environment.
- **Guardrails**: Pre-configured governance rules for security, operations, and compliance.
    - **Preventive Guardrails**: Implemented using SCPs to prevent actions.
    - **Detective Guardrails**: Implemented using AWS Config rules to detect non-compliance.
- **Account Factory**: A standardized way to provision new AWS accounts within your organization that automatically conform to your defined baseline and guardrails.
- **Dashboard**: Provides centralized visibility into the compliance status of your accounts against the enabled guardrails.

### 📝 Core Idea
- Automates the setup of a secure, compliant, multi-account AWS environment (landing zone) and provides ongoing governance.

### 🔄 Differences
- **vs. AWS Organizations**:
    - Control Tower *uses* AWS Organizations as a foundational component.
    - Organizations provides the *tools* for multi-account management (account creation, OUs, SCPs, consolidated billing).
    - Control Tower is an *opinionated, automated solution* built on top of Organizations (and other services) that sets up a best-practice landing zone and provides a higher-level governance framework with pre-defined guardrails and an account factory.
    - You can use Organizations without Control Tower, but Control Tower simplifies the initial setup and ongoing governance significantly.

- **Security**: Sharing is controlled using resource shares and permissions.

### 📝 Core Idea
- Facilitates secure sharing of specific AWS resources across different AWS accounts, reducing duplication and centralizing management.

### 🔄 Differences
- While AWS Organizations helps manage *accounts* and their *permission boundaries* (SCPs), RAM focuses on sharing *specific service resources* (like subnets or Transit Gateways) *between* those accounts. RAM often works in conjunction with Organizations for easier sharing within an org.

---

## 🔹 74. AWS Service Catalog
---
### 📖 Description
- Allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. End-users (like developers) can then browse and launch these approved services without needing direct, granular access to the underlying AWS services.

### ⚙️ Key Features
- **Standardization & Governance**: Ensure users deploy only approved and properly configured resources, adhering to organizational standards and compliance requirements.
- **Self-Service**: Enables users to quickly discover and deploy needed IT services on their own, through a curated catalog.
- **Products and Portfolios**:
    - **Products**: IT services you want to make available for deployment (typically defined using CloudFormation templates, but can also be other types).
    - **Portfolios**: Collections of products, along with configuration information and access control for specific users, groups, or roles.
- **Version Control**: Manage different versions of products, allowing updates and rollback.
- **Constraint Management**: Apply constraints to products (e.g., limit instance types, enforce tagging, specify launch roles) to ensure compliance.

# Pricing & Cost Management

## 🔹 75. Pricing Models in AWS
---
### 📖 Description
- AWS offers a variety of pricing models to accommodate different use cases and allow customers to optimize costs based on their usage patterns and commitment levels.

### ⚙️ Key Models (for Cloud Practitioner Exam)
- **On-Demand Instances (e.g., for EC2, RDS)**:
    - Pay for compute or database capacity by the hour or second (varies by service/instance type, e.g., Linux EC2 is per-second).
    - No long-term commitments or upfront payments.
    - Most flexible, but typically highest per-unit cost.
    - Good for workloads with unpredictable spikes, or for development/testing.
- **Reserved Instances (RIs) (e.g., for EC2, RDS, Redshift, ElastiCache, OpenSearch)**:
    - Provide a significant discount (up to 72% for EC2) compared to On-Demand pricing.
    - Requires a commitment to a specific instance type, region (and sometimes AZ for Zonal RIs) for a 1-year or 3-year term.
    - Payment options: All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront.
    - Good for steady-state, predictable workloads.
    - Types: Standard RIs (less flexible, best discount), Convertible RIs (more flexible to change instance attributes, smaller discount).
- **Savings Plans (e.g., for EC2, Fargate, Lambda)**:
    - A flexible pricing model offering lower prices compared to On-Demand, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1-year or 3-year term.
    - **Compute Savings Plans**: Most flexible. Apply automatically to EC2 instance usage regardless of instance family, size, AZ, region, OS, or tenancy. Also applies to Fargate and Lambda.
    - **EC2 Instance Savings Plans**: Offer the deepest discounts (same as Standard RIs). Commit to usage of a specific instance family in a chosen region (e.g., m5 in us-east-1).
    - Generally more flexible than RIs.
- **Spot Instances (for EC2)**:
    - Request spare EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off the On-Demand price.
    - AWS can reclaim these instances with a 2-minute notification if they need the capacity back.
    - Excellent for fault-tolerant, flexible, stateless workloads that can handle interruptions (e.g., batch processing, big data analytics, test/dev environments).
- **Pay-as-you-go (General AWS Philosophy)**:
    - For many services (e.g., S3 storage, SQS messages, Lambda invocations/duration), you pay only for what you use, with no minimum fees or long-term commitments.
- **Tiered Pricing (e.g., for S3, Data Transfer Out)**:
    - The per-unit cost decreases as your usage increases. The more you use, the less you pay per GB (for example).
- **Free Tier**:
    - Allows new AWS customers to use certain services up to specified limits for free for 12 months (e.g., EC2 t2.micro/t3.micro, S3 storage).
    - Some services offer an "always free" tier even after the initial 12 months.

### 📝 Core Idea
- AWS provides various pricing options (On-Demand, Reserved, Savings Plans, Spot, Tiered, Free Tier) allowing customers to optimize costs based on their workload characteristics, predictability, and commitment.
